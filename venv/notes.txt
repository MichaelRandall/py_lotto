Version 1 plan:
This app generates a mock set of lottery numbers
and allows the user to enter a number of attempts
after which point, all of the attempts are compared
to the mock set of lottery numbers and a winner
is determined if there is one and not otherwise

Version 2 plan:
Reverse order and see how many times it takes to match the winning set of number
